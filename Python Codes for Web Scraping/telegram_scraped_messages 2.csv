2025-01-31 03:09:34+00:00,6592370515,Can you adjust for me to .1
2025-01-31 03:09:12+00:00,6592370515,And I have no way to tell what it is
2025-01-31 03:09:01+00:00,6592370515,However my public IP showing isn't correct because of vpn
2025-01-31 03:08:46+00:00,6592370515,Hey guys I moved to solo mine but my pool mine account has balance and I want to change it to pay out @ .1
2025-01-30 15:38:37+00:00,572615204,"No.
The pool pays out FLUX only in the FLUX network."
2025-01-30 15:28:17+00:00,5180399252,"Hi admin, Can I mine Flux with Flux ERC20 Wallet?"
2025-01-30 13:51:03+00:00,6424054757,OK OK that explains it. I thought it was the whole pool on BTC payout. Thank you again for your time
2025-01-30 13:50:22+00:00,282798414,Most of the miners on the BTG payouts
2025-01-30 13:50:08+00:00,282798414,The BTC payouts are used by several miners
2025-01-30 13:50:01+00:00,282798414,There are no BTC payouts for a while but BTG payouts
2025-01-30 13:48:29+00:00,6424054757,hence my question if the 2miners pool will just keep mining or not
2025-01-30 13:47:41+00:00,6424054757,I didn't assume that. But the network is supported and secured mainly by miners. 2miners is the largest mining pool for BTG with more than 3/4 of all BTG mined. But miners need to pay their bills. So no payout: risk of losing miners. And solo miners will probably also avoid mining at current BTG prices. Doesn't that pose a risk for the network?
2025-01-30 13:45:37+00:00,282798414,You can't change something in it even if you're the creator
2025-01-30 13:45:04+00:00,282798414,There's no changes in the BTG network
2025-01-30 13:41:46+00:00,6424054757,"Just one more question... Does the pool keep mining, even without the BTC payouts?"
2025-01-30 13:34:20+00:00,6424054757,"damn... that's huge. I mean, not surprising with the whole Jack Liao scam going... thank you sir"
2025-01-30 13:29:23+00:00,572615204,BTG deposit suspended
2025-01-30 13:23:39+00:00,6424054757,"closed, also on Gate??? I searched through their notifications but couldn't find any news around BTG."
2025-01-30 13:22:14+00:00,572615204,"Currently BTG deposits on exchanges are closed. 
Waiting."
2025-01-30 09:22:27+00:00,6424054757,"Hi, just wondering, is this already fixed?"
2025-01-29 21:04:44+00:00,6592370515,Spammmm
2025-01-29 20:29:19+00:00,6592370515,"If your minor stops, you usually have 30 days or so to continue to mine and you won't lose your current unpaid value"
2025-01-29 20:18:05+00:00,282798414,"Increase the min payout value, get 50 KAS, turn off hashpower, decrease the min payout value"
2025-01-29 20:16:10+00:00,7558032351,Will do that but there will always remain some small balance.
2025-01-29 20:11:09+00:00,282798414,Turn on or use hashpower rentals
2025-01-29 19:58:18+00:00,7558032351,"And if my miner stopped, o’ll lose the balance?"
2025-01-29 18:59:11+00:00,282798414,Your balance is less than the min payout value
2025-01-29 18:22:31+00:00,7558032351,"Wallet 
kaspa:qpf55vefcp66cvmjeuxsrvj99fyplustx4tlurq3hcjf593pmp36v5st407uj"
2025-01-29 18:20:33+00:00,7558032351,"Hello, I need manual payout for kas pls. Finished mining"
2025-01-29 06:37:54+00:00,572615204,"There are no such plans. 
Maybe in the future."
2025-01-29 04:39:11+00:00,1446094358,Any update on when 2Miners will support btc payouts for neoxa pool? Is this still a consideration?
2025-01-28 21:10:28+00:00,6592370515,Every coin is different and you can adjust your payout on your page when you search for the wallet address
2025-01-28 21:10:11+00:00,6592370515,The default payout is whatever the minimum is for that coin
2025-01-28 20:55:58+00:00,916090782,When does payout goto wallet? Is the timeframe for payout adjustable? What is a share worth let’s say 150G is equivalent to what?
2025-01-28 19:31:48+00:00,916090782,Thank you
2025-01-28 19:28:16+00:00,537147076,Search your wallet address after first share in pool
2025-01-28 19:27:50+00:00,916090782,Changed wallets and got rid of worker name and it’s mining. Thank you. At what point do I know it’s going into the wallet?
2025-01-28 19:18:49+00:00,537147076,check your wallet address and try without the rig name
2025-01-28 19:16:15+00:00,537147076,show me the miner configuration
2025-01-28 19:15:12+00:00,6592370515,What does that mean
2025-01-28 19:13:40+00:00,6592370515,What cards do you have
2025-01-28 19:13:13+00:00,6592370515,You won't make anything. Etc can only be mined with asics
2025-01-28 19:13:02+00:00,6592370515,If you are mining etc with GPU you need to change coins
2025-01-28 19:12:56+00:00,1519537265,"Be patient, someone will be with you."
