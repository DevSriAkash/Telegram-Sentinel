https://2miners.com/blog/january-2025-work-progress-report-changes-to-btc-payouts-for-bitcoin-gold-mining/

January 2025 brought key updates for the 2Miners mining pool, including critical node upgrades, block reward reductions, and changes to Bitcoin payouts for Bitcoin Gold (BTG) mining. Let's take a closer look at all the changes."
2025-02-03 09:01:36+00:00,282798414,18 shares were sent
2025-02-03 08:59:08+00:00,7558410720,thanks man i appreciate ur help
2025-02-03 08:58:34+00:00,7558410720,can anyone tell me what 18 accept means
2025-02-03 08:58:27+00:00,282798414,"Payouts are processed automatically if the min payout has been reached
10 RVN by default"
2025-02-03 08:56:17+00:00,7558410720,"Hello guys im new to crypto mining, and im currently mining ravencoin, can anyone exlpain how to take payout"
2025-02-02 15:00:42+00:00,6592370515,Way to kill a real coin
2025-02-02 15:00:32+00:00,6592370515,Xmc did same shit. They converted using gate from one XMC to a Solana token lol wtf
2025-02-02 14:56:57+00:00,6424054757,So weird that you guys seem to ignore that BTG mining will never be profitable again after it disappears from exchanges.  Btw do NOT leave any BTG on gate io after the 7th or you will end up with some scam token minted by Jack of which he will own like 90%
2025-02-02 14:19:47+00:00,282798414,Will be paid automatically
2025-02-02 13:51:24+00:00,1042173983,I meant for balances over the minimum payout threshold but below the threshold set by the user via account settings
2025-02-02 12:59:45+00:00,282798414,Check probit com
2025-02-02 12:59:25+00:00,282798414,Probably will stay at the pool because this amount is less than payout fees for a BTC payout
2025-02-02 12:56:40+00:00,1294844296,"Any working exchange, wallet or website is available to sell/exchange BTG without doing KYC?"
2025-02-02 10:42:54+00:00,1042173983,"Yes, for balances that haven't reached pending payout from the past few days"
2025-02-02 10:38:55+00:00,282798414,With BTC payouts?
2025-02-02 10:23:13+00:00,1042173983,"What will happen to balances that haven't reached a set payout threshold, but is above the default minimum payout?"
2025-02-02 09:22:12+00:00,537147076,most probably it will be permanent
2025-02-02 09:21:26+00:00,788947287,is this permanent or just temporary?
2025-02-02 07:41:17+00:00,-1001187507443,"**BTC Payouts Disabled for BTG Mining**

We provided the option to receive BTC payouts for mining Bitcoin Gold (BTG), facilitated through the Gate.io exchange.

As [Gate.io is closing BTG deposits](https://www.gate.io/announcements/article/43080) in the coming days, BTC payouts for BTG mining will no longer be available.

From now on, all BTG mining payouts will be made exclusively in BTG.

Pending BTC payouts from the past few days will be processed if the exchange completes the necessary deposit transactions."
2025-02-02 04:59:26+00:00,862958235,5090 price high lol
2025-02-02 04:51:13+00:00,6592370515,Holy shit those h200 way expensive
2025-02-02 04:32:30+00:00,6592370515,I would rent the power for that
2025-02-02 04:32:20+00:00,6592370515,@duckingcraft however looks like those can do ai
2025-02-02 04:31:44+00:00,572615204,"Has the minimum payout value been reached?
Is there payment information in the miner's account on the pool website in the Payouts tab?"
2025-02-02 04:23:30+00:00,6592370515,Not sure. I don't think so
2025-02-02 04:14:53+00:00,5949910916,Who can tell me if this GPU can be used for mining?
2025-02-02 04:10:19+00:00,2082680354,"I chose Bitcoin mining payment, but I didn't receive Bitcoin."

2025-02-01 20:17:47+00:00,6424054757,"As miners, you should really raise your voice against Gate because this means the end of BTG and BTG mining. (assuming that the remaining Korean exchanges may follow Gate in this...)"
2025-02-01 20:16:26+00:00,6424054757,"After this ""merge"" Gate will no longer support the original BTG, and will probably delist it too"
2025-02-01 20:15:58+00:00,6424054757,Not sure if you guys already heard but Gate IO will support Jack Liao's scam merge of the original BTG to some fake newly minted BTG token that he created on BTC
2025-02-01 16:59:27+00:00,-1001187507443,"**Karlsen (KLS) reward reduction has happened.**

In accordance with the [Karlsencoin Tokenomics](https://www.karlsencoin.com/tokenomics.html) and [KARLSEN EMISSION SCHEDULE](https://karlsencoin.com/docs/karlsen-whitepaper-v1.0.1.pdf), there was a reward reduction in the Karlsen block.

The block reward for miners was reduced from 35.15 KLS to 34.19 KLS.

Please pay attention!

2025-02-01 16:45:45+00:00,6592370515,So you have 1 z15 I'm assuming
2025-02-01 16:45:25+00:00,6592370515,Gotcha nm then
2025-02-01 16:36:12+00:00,679213446,I have only 1 payout per month.
2025-02-01 15:15:34+00:00,6592370515,So you may want to increase your minimum payout
2025-02-01 15:15:23+00:00,6592370515,"And how many miners do you have mining? The larger the payout in my opinion, the quicker the exchange happens. The smaller payouts actually take longer sometimes"
2025-02-01 15:15:04+00:00,6592370515,"You won't lose anything, it just takes a little bit for the exchange to take place"
2025-02-01 14:50:48+00:00,679213446,Ok thanks will wait till evening. Hope payment will come today.
2025-02-01 14:49:16+00:00,6592370515,They try to get the highest exchange rate so it isn't always fast because they put the order in then wait for it to be filled instead of buying spot BTC and losing $$$ for miner
2025-02-01 14:48:45+00:00,6592370515,It takes 5-6 hours for withdrawal and exchange and transfer
2025-02-01 14:47:42+00:00,679213446,"Hi admins, please answer what's happened with ZEC-to-BTC today conversion and payout? Coins are gone from account but nothing in payment and on my destination wallet."
2025-02-01 09:37:47+00:00,8157307378,Yes
2025-02-01 06:37:11+00:00,537147076,All working fine. Just low hashrate on pool and bad luck
2025-02-01 03:14:26+00:00,5961220120,What’s going on with the BCH pool. It’s been quite along time since a block was found. Are we live on that or is there a problem?
2025-02-01 02:42:11+00:00,6592370515,Also can't believe y'all even do the BTC exchange that's a new feature my customers like and sometimes it pays more than nicehash depending on algo
2025-02-01 02:01:07+00:00,6592370515,Gracia
2025-02-01 02:00:55+00:00,6592370515,2miners is one of the only places that offers easy no Bs solo pool
